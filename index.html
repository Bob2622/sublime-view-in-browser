			<h1>Sublime Text 2 - View In Browser</h1>
			<p>
				<em>View In Browser</em> is a Sublime Text 2 plugin that will open whatever is in your
				current view/tab. If the file current open is new and has not been saved a temporary 
				file is created (in your default temp directory for your OS) with the extension of 
				<strong>.htm</strong> and your browser will open it. However if the current open file is saved
				and has a name this plugin will open it in whatever you have set to handle
				its type.
			</p>

			<p>By default the keystroke assigned to this plugin is <em>CTRL + ALT + V</em>.</p>

			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>
				Using the Sublime Text 2 Package Control plugin (<a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control</a>)
				press <em>CTRL + SHIFT + P</em> and find <strong>Package Control: Install Package</strong> and press <em>Enter</em>.
				Find this plugin in the list by name <strong>View In Browser</strong>.
			</p>

			<h2>Configuring Browsers</h2>

			<p>
				By default this plugin will open files in Firefox. You can configure it to open
				using another browser of your choice. To do this, choose <em>Settings - User</em> from <em>Preferences &gt; Package Settings &gt; View In Browser</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The browser you wish to use to open files is set in the key named <strong>selectedBrowser</strong>. The list of browsers
				you can use and configure are in the key named <strong>supportedBrowsers</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <strong>supportedBrowsers</strong> values can be configured to have paths to your browser installations.
				Each browser listed is an array (list) of configurations that allow you to setup a browser
				for multiple operating systems. For example under <em>chrome</em> there are two configurations.
				The first is for your average Linux system. The second is for Windows. 
			</p>

			<h3>Windows Considerations</h3>

			<p>
				One of the things you may notice in the Windows configuration for <em>chrome</em> is a variable in
				the command path that looks like: <strong>%Local AppData%</strong>. This is a reference to your Windows
				installation's <strong>AppData</strong> folder in your user profile directory. There is a variable
				there because this value will differ for each user on your computer, and Chrome installs
				to your <strong>AppData</strong> folder.
			</p>

			<p>Here is a list of supported variables:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>AppData</strong> - Your main application data folder for your profile (usually roaming)</li>
				<li><strong>Personal</strong> - Your documents location</li>
				<li><strong>Desktop</strong> - The path to your Desktop location (may be unreliable)</li>
				<li><strong>Start Menu</strong> - The path to your Start Menu items location</li>
				<li><strong>Local AppData</strong> - Your local application data folder for your profile</li>
				<li><strong>My Video</strong> - Path to your videos location</li>
				<li><strong>My Pictures</strong> - Path to your pictures location</li>
				<li><strong>My Music</strong> - Path to your music location</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Note that many of these are not terribly useful for determining browser location, unless you
				have decided to install Firefox in your My Music folder. 
			</p>

			<h2>Configure to View on Local Server</h2>

			<p>
				The View In Browser plugin also supports the ability to view files in the context of
				a local server. So if you have a local Apache, Tomcat, or some other server application running
				you can configure this plugin to open your file prefixed with a URL. 
			</p>

			<p>
				To configure this the View In Browser plugin reads the configuration of your currently
				loaded project. You can edit a project file by opening the <em>sublime-project</em> file
				by choosing <strong>Project</strong> -&gt; <strong>Edit Project</strong>. In your project file you will need to specify 
				two things:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>baseUrl</strong> - The root URL to prefix files with </li>
				<li><strong>basePath</strong> - The base path where your site/application lives</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Here's how that looks.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"folders"</span><span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s2">"path"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"/home/&lt;username&gt;/code/python/my-cool-website"</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="s2">"settings"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"sublime-view-in-browser"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s2">"baseUrl"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"http://localhost:8080"</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="s2">"basePath"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"/home/&lt;username&gt;/code/python/my-cool-website"</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

			<p>
				Notice the key named <strong>settings</strong> which is a dictionary that contains another key named
				<strong>sublime-view-in-browser</strong>. This is where you will put your <strong>baseUrl</strong> and <strong>basePath</strong>
				settings.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now when you activate View In Browser your file will open with the HTTP protocol instead
				of the FILE protocol.
			</p>
