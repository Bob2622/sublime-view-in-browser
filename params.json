	"body": "# Sublime Text 2 - View In Browser\r\n\r\n*View In Browser* is a Sublime Text 2 plugin that will open whatever is in your\r\ncurrent view/tab. If the file current open is new and has not been saved a temporary \r\nfile is created (in your default temp directory for your OS) with the extension of \r\n**.htm** and your browser will open it. However if the current open file is saved\r\nand has a name this plugin will open it in whatever you have set to handle\r\nits type.\r\n\r\nBy default the keystroke assigned to this plugin is *CTRL + ALT + V*.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nUsing the Sublime Text 2 Package Control plugin (http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)\r\npress *CTRL + SHIFT + P* and find **Package Control: Install Package** and press *Enter*.\r\nFind this plugin in the list by name **View In Browser**.\r\n\r\n## Configuring Browsers\r\nBy default this plugin will open files in Firefox. You can configure it to open\r\nusing another browser of your choice. To do this, choose *Settings - User* from *Preferences > Package Settings > View In Browser*.\r\n\r\nThe browser you wish to use to open files is set in the key named **selectedBrowser**. The list of browsers\r\nyou can use and configure are in the key named **supportedBrowsers**.\r\n\r\nThe **supportedBrowsers** values can be configured to have paths to your browser installations.\r\nEach browser listed is an array (list) of configurations that allow you to setup a browser\r\nfor multiple operating systems. For example under *chrome* there are two configurations.\r\nThe first is for your average Linux system. The second is for Windows. \r\n\r\n### Windows Considerations\r\nOne of the things you may notice in the Windows configuration for *chrome* is a variable in\r\nthe command path that looks like: **%Local AppData%**. This is a reference to your Windows\r\ninstallation's **AppData** folder in your user profile directory. There is a variable\r\nthere because this value will differ for each user on your computer, and Chrome installs\r\nto your **AppData** folder.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of supported variables:\r\n\r\n* **AppData** - Your main application data folder for your profile (usually roaming)\r\n* **Personal** - Your documents location\r\n* **Desktop** - The path to your Desktop location (may be unreliable)\r\n* **Start Menu** - The path to your Start Menu items location\r\n* **Local AppData** - Your local application data folder for your profile\r\n* **My Video** - Path to your videos location\r\n* **My Pictures** - Path to your pictures location\r\n* **My Music** - Path to your music location\r\n\r\nNote that many of these are not terribly useful for determining browser location, unless you\r\nhave decided to install Firefox in your My Music folder. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Configure to View on Local Server\r\nThe View In Browser plugin also supports the ability to view files in the context of\r\na local server. So if you have a local Apache, Tomcat, or some other server application running\r\nyou can configure this plugin to open your file prefixed with a URL. \r\n\r\nTo configure this the View In Browser plugin reads the configuration of your currently\r\nloaded project. You can edit a project file by opening the *sublime-project* file\r\nby choosing **Project** -> **Edit Project**. In your project file you will need to specify \r\ntwo things:\r\n\r\n* **baseUrl** - The root URL to prefix files with \r\n* **basePath** - The base path where your site/application lives\r\n\r\nHere's how that looks.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n\t\"folders\":\r\n\t[\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/home/<username>/code/python/my-cool-website\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"settings\": {\r\n\t\t\"sublime-view-in-browser\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"baseUrl\": \"http://localhost:8080\",\r\n\t\t\t\"basePath\": \"/home/<username>/code/python/my-cool-website\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the key named **settings** which is a dictionary that contains another key named\r\n**sublime-view-in-browser**. This is where you will put your **baseUrl** and **basePath**\r\nsettings.\r\n\r\nNow when you activate View In Browser your file will open with the HTTP protocol instead\r\nof the FILE protocol.\r\n\r\n## Change History\r\n\r\n* 03/08/2013:\r\n   * Avoid loading Windows special folder references when on a Mac\r\n   * Added Mac Chrome to the supported browsers list\r\n* 02/18/2013:\r\n   * Added ability to use Windows special folder references to browser commands. Closes \r\n     <a href=\"https://github.com/adampresley/sublime-view-in-browser/issues/10\">#10</a>\r\n* 01/30/2013:\r\n   * All settings for this plugin now live in the file **View In Browser.sublime-settings**.\r\n     This allows for a user to override them in their *User* directory.
