Sublime Text 2 - View In Browser
================================

*View In Browser* is a Sublime Text 2 plugin that will open whatever is in your
current view/tab in your default web browser. A temporary file is created (in
your default temp directory for your OS) with the extension of **.htm** and
your browser will open it. By default the keystroke assigned to this plugin
is *CTRL + ALT + V*.
